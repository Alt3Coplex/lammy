# Lessons

- For website image paths, always use the correct relative path (e.g., 'images/filename.png') and ensure the images directory exists
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- When using Jest, a test suite can fail even if all individual tests pass, typically due to issues in suite-level setup code or lifecycle hooks

# Current Task: Remove Docker Configuration and Fix Security Issues

## Task Description
Need to remove Docker configuration files and address security concerns with exposed API keys in the Dockerfile.

## Progress
[X] Identified security issue with exposed Supabase API keys in Dockerfile
[X] Removed docker-compose.yml
[X] Removed .dockerignore
[X] Remove Dockerfile with sensitive information
[X] Removed Dockerfile.dev
[X] Verify all Docker-related files are removed
[ ] Document security recommendations for API key handling

## Security Recommendations
1. Move all sensitive information to .env.local (Already done âœ“)
2. Rotate exposed Supabase keys immediately (URGENT!)
3. Check git history for exposed secrets
4. Use proper environment variable handling in deployment

## Lessons
1. **Security**: Never store API keys or sensitive credentials in Dockerfile or any version-controlled files
2. **Environment Variables**: Always use .env files for sensitive configuration
3. **Docker Best Practices**: Use build arguments (ARG) or runtime environment variables instead of hardcoding values
4. **Version Control**: Always check files for sensitive information before committing
5. **File Organization**: Keep track of all configuration files (.dockerignore, Dockerfile.dev) when cleaning up

## Next Steps
1. Help user rotate Supabase keys (URGENT due to exposure)
2. Clean git history if needed
3. Consider setting up GitHub Actions secrets for future deployments
